# An agile website to track research priorities and progress in improving stock assessment advice in the Gulf of Mexico

This website is intended to provide a living roadmap for planning and tracking research and development effort towards improving stock assessment methods and workflows in the Gulf of Mexico. This roadmap will maintain a dynamic record of ongoing and planned research carried out under a [5 year RESTORE FFO 2023 Actionable Science grant](https://restoreactscienceprogram.noaa.gov/projects/building-next-generation-fishery-forecasting-capacity). Providing a dynamic accounting of ongoing and planned research is intended to facilitate, agile development, adaptative research prioritization, and collaboration opportunities with other research efforts as promoted through NOAA's [NMFS Open Science intiative](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/). Additionally this roadmap is intended to facilitate improved stakeholder and user awareness of and engagement with ongoing research efforts and priorities, providing a basis for feedback and discussion.
